Course content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This course is intended for graduate students in engineering to present 
  the fundamental results of the analysis and design of nonlinear control 
  systems. Especially, this course is concerned with the analysis tools for 
  nonlinear dynamical systems and the design techniques for nonlinear 
  control systems. Emphasis is placed upon application of the theory to 
  systems of interest to the students. Included is an outline of topics to 
  be covered in the course. 

•	Nonlinear phenomena
•	Phase plane analysis
•	Mathematical foundation
•	Lyapunov stability theorem
•	Variable gradient method
•	Advanced stability theorem
•	Input-output stability
•	Asymptotic techniques
•	Circle & Popov criteria
•	Describing function method
•	Feedback linearization
•	Lyapunov redesign
•	Back stepping
•	Sliding mode control
•	High gain observers
